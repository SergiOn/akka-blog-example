This repository contains sample code for implementing a trivial blog microservice
using [Akka](http://akka.io/) and [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/). The ideas
being demonstrated here include CQRS and event sourcing, actors, and various
Scala syntax concepts. Some inspiration for Akka-related patterns used here are
from the [Akka in Action source code](https://github.com/RayRoestenburg/akka-in-action).
